#  [[Linking Your Thinking]]

## UNIT 1 - PKM & Idea Emergence
 
**Linked Notes**- Now, with the ability to make fast notes, free notes, and smaller, concise notes—the need arose for a way to manage them better. Folders are no longer enough. Notes should be able to live in more than one place—just like how in our brains, many things can trigger the same idea. Enter the `Linked Note` and here we are.S-LYT Workshop
	
It matters how you set up your digital library so that will grow and evolve with you, not just for this month, not for the year, but throughout your entire life

> _**The ability to make meaningful notes, across genre, and throughout time.**_

Collecting is addictive. And easy. It feels good to “clip” a new article into our note library. It feels like progress. But that’s a fallacy. You haven’t done anything. This is the [**"Collector’s Fallacy"** ](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/) and it’s a disease we’ve inflicted upon ourselves.

Because once you start note-_making_, your note library only grows more valuable over time. Now apply the Compound Effect:

Making quality notes + consistency + time = RADICAL VALUE CREATED

_In this way, your notes act as an evolving and contributing library of insights that you take with you throughout your life—across projects, careers, and decades.

The Zettelkasten Method; which is essentially writing **FAST notes**, on note cards, in your __own words__, **one idea per card**, with a link to another card. When this method is applied to our digital notes, the magic starts to happen. We can work as quickly as we can think—which is what we are fully adapted to nowadays. It’s just what we expect.

> _Instead of using rigid folder-only structure, we now have the ability to use flexible Fluid Frameworks._

Link-based notes allow us to do just that. So how can we become more masterful at using links? I believe it helps tremendously to understand what’s happening beneath the surface.

As we use links, interesting patterns start to form. These patterns follow “Systems Thinking” and jive with terms like “emergence, divergence, and convergence.” So, in essence, Link-based notes follow the rules of Systems Theory. Before jumping into “Idea Emergence” let’s define the terms of Systems Thinking.

- **Emergence** refers to the existence or formation of collective behaviors
- **Complexity** is basically how many units of information we’re looking at in a given system. In this case, the more links, the more complexity.
- **Divergence** is basically when things become unique.
- **Convergence** is basically when things become unified.

### Idea Emergence

https://twitter.com/NickMilo/status/1317190776284086272
 
#### Level 1

Primordial idea soup: sources, memories, ideas, interactions, insights, things that you’ve come across

![https://res.cloudinary.com/dagkspppt/image/upload/v1615063554/2021-03-06\_14-45-35\_h2pacs.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dagkspppt/image/upload/v1615063554/2021-03-06_14-45-35_h2pacs.png)
				
##### Level 2

This is when we start linking ideas and direct relationships are formed. This is the basic of Zettelkasten.

The beauty of the direct link is that bigger ideas start to emerge organically. This is a well-oiled Zettelkasten.

The limitation is that you’re always at eye-level with you notes

##### Level 3

Maps of Contents (MOC’s) are the solution for giving one a birds eye view; or glimpse of the the galaxy of your notes and thinking.

This allows for a meditative flow, careful attitude and ease to stay with the note making process drawing benefit from each step. One does not have that horrid feeling of a suitcase busting at the seams!

MOC’s can be used as spaces of chambers where concepts can be developed and relationships can be formed; all without disruptive impact on other areas. This way thoughts can be give a chance to live or die; we give the meaningful ones a go.

**Massive emergence, convergence, and divergence**

![https://res.cloudinary.com/dagkspppt/image/upload/v1615063750/2021-03-06\_14-48-02\_dwah2d.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dagkspppt/image/upload/v1615063750/2021-03-06_14-48-02_dwah2d.png)
				
#### Level 4
**Linking MOC’s to MOC’s**; having places to develop different levels of relationships means we have a living nervous system of thought .

MOCs are linked to MOCs. Instead of a just having living systems—like a standard Zettelkasten—now we have living ecosystems!

**Less divergence, plenty of convergence**
![https://res.cloudinary.com/dagkspppt/image/upload/v1615063791/2021-03-06\_14-49-33\_npfcma.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dagkspppt/image/upload/v1615063791/2021-03-06_14-49-33_npfcma.png)

#### Level 5

Linking MOC’s to MOC’s; having places to develop different levels of relationships means we have a living nervous system of thought .

All about Convergence, which allows for top-down “Convergent” thinking like navigating and deliberate creating. It also allows for bottom-up “Convergent” thinking by consolidating new forms of emergence

### Fluid Frameworks with High Order Notes (MOCs)

Fluid frameworks are non-rigid, highly-flexible organizing structures that you can use as needed. When we talk about fluid frameworks in the “Linking Your Thinking” System, we’re mainly referring to higher-order notes like MOCs and the Home note.

#### Special aspects of MOCs
-   non-destructive (the notes that are linked within are not affected)
-   non-limiting (you can create as many variations of “structure” as you want)
-   non-exclusive (MOCs don’t limit discoverability)
-   fluid (they are flexible and can form to whatever your purposes are)
-   coexisting (MOCs don’t impede other MOCs)
-   heterarchial (there is no hard-coded, rigid top-down structure)
-   augment-able (you can use MOCs to augment your viewpoint of your library)
-   overlapping (MOCs can link to the same notes, no big deal)
-   neighborly (MOCs are there when you need them; but they stay out of the way when you don’t—and your base notes are still just as usable)
-   delete-able (you can delete MOCs and your notes remain unaltered)
    -   you’ve lost _value_, but you haven’t lost _information_

#### Making Relationships

how we can form useful relationships between notes, we’re going to lean heavily into this metaphor.


> Make a system that works
>  - Be systematic in how information is processed. Be consistent in how tags, tiles, links and folders are used. (Maybe start with a \[key\]) Likewise with formatting.
> - Use the note making process as a mindfulness actively; keeping things consistent and aesthetic (doing the job properly, or at least when updating.)
> - Make a system that is simple and can grow and shrink without getting lost.
> - Take the time to learn the program shortcuts and develop basic templates for common content types.
> - Base the system on ones higher purpose and compass; that these things help one gather in the right direct.
> - Be willing to change and adapt, but also give things a good trial with out changing to quickly so one can tune into what works.
> - Have a real process in place, so one dosn’t regress into chaotic or lazy study and note making habits.
> - Keep the process simple; and be frugal in what is kept.
> - Grow idea but don’t be in a rush and expand things out of control.
> - Make the system work on paper as well, so it is easy to input notes at a later date.
> - Have a period for pruning and reducing, or for cleaning up content and formatting.
> - Learn how to best make use of MOC’s, links, tags and folders; put the time in now to come up with an understanding so the relationships can be built in a consistent manner.
> - Even while building this system and inputting, try to keep a flow in meditative awareness.
> - Link the MOC’s and content back to ones highest aspirations and values to make sure one is heading in the right direction. 
> _Bhante Kassapa_


#### Using links
> _(they are the)_ purest and most explicit way of connecting two notes. This is the core method of growing a healthy, dynamic Zettelkasten.

#### Using folders

Folders are rigid and exclusionary by their nature. Whatever is in a folder lives separated from the main collection. **It’s a rigid hierarchy that imposes order**. Without special workarounds this limits note accessibility, discourages interdisciplinary thinking, and stunts the long-term growth of a complex and interesting Zettelkasten.

> But know this: **retreating too much into project-based folder management will cripple your long-term thinking partner (i.e., your Zettelkasten) from growing complex, dynamic, and interesting cross-genre connections**. You won’t have a Zettelkasten, you’ll have a collection of silo-ed folders. Those are massive costs to consider.

That said, limiting accessibility may be ideal for private information like finances, health, and private journaling. Then a folder is the perfect instrumental to intentionally cordon off those notes from the rest.

#### Using tags

Tags are used for defining weak relationships, some examples may be:

-   Rating a note based on intuition
-   Type of note e.g. permanent-note, evergreen-notes, meditative-note
-   The state of a note 
-   The feeling or nature of a note e.g. sobering, inspirational, tranquil
-   The importance of a note e.g. critical,important, neutral, un-important` 
-   The genres it may fall into.
-   subject matters that are peculiar to oneself
-   and maybe key concepts one is really digging into e.g. pkm, fasting, meditation.

#### Using proximity

There are 3 basic levels of proximity.
1.  In the main folder: Alphabetical, chronological and topical
2.  In the same subfolder. Notes in the same subfolder will have a closer relationship since they are grouped in the same vicinity. But this comes at the cost of being silo-ed from the rest of the note library.
3.  In a MOC. -   Notes in the same MOC are very likely to be closely related, especially after they are manually sorted in some form of relational positioning. This is the best way to apply the power of proximity.

### The Age of Linked Notes
- Fast Notes
- Free Notes
- Atomic Notes - Bite sized ideas

## Unit 2 - Growing Value

The _“Time Value of Money”_ refers to the notion that money available now is worth more than the same amount in the future.

  In PKM:
- Having a growing collection of emerging and converging thoughts and ideas can help future-proof YOU to the randomness of life.
- [[The Compound Effect]] _making_ notes now allows them to make you value immediately—through being available to recall, reference, and connect to other emergent ideas.

> Better to be proactive; and make the process work, refine and develop ideas and knowledge as it comes into contact with ones system. That way one can consistently know one is improving not degrading. Making meaningful understanding not adding confusion. That one is distilling not diluting.

### The time value of each phase of PKM.

We don't create value when we collecting. Sustainable and re-usable value it should be part of the development phase.

### LYT System
- Create ideas
- Create Maps of content,while unifying, assembling and colliding MOCs
- This helps to create new ideas or evergreen notes
This process encourages originality to be applied to the things you encounter.

![https://res.cloudinary.com/dagkspppt/image/upload/v1615064083/2021-03-06\_14-54-21\_hqjnhq.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dagkspppt/image/upload/v1615064083/2021-03-06_14-54-21_hqjnhq.png)


## The Compound Effect of note-taking

**"Progressive Summarization"** is a technique for collecting digital information — like an article — and then strategically deferring how you process it into incremental steps over time. It’s supposed to reduce the time you waste on articles you process, because you don’t spend time deepening your level of processing on an article until you actually have the need to.

“Progressive Summarization” is trying to solve the problem that comes from saving too many things. It asks: “How do you balance compressing stuff to make it easier to discover articles you encounter, while preserving the article’s original context for full understanding?”

If overused, “Progressive Summarization" will develop the following habits:

1. _Over-collecting_ - encourages the habit of “collecting without processing”
2. _Under-thinking by over-summarizing_ - In terms of improving your memory or thinking ability [bolding and highlighting stuff can create a false sense of learning 10](https://pcl.sitehost.iu.edu/rgoldsto/courses/cogscilearning/dunloskiimprovingstudentlearning.pdf). So if you want to improve your memory and recall, or if you want to think better—which many of us want to do—Progressive Summarization won’t help much. Re-summarizing multiple times — which “Progressive Summarization” encourages — creates the illusion of progress: We mistake **_familiarity_** with **_ability_**.
3.  _Reduced quality thinking and unique output_
4. _Poor long-term health_

>Instead of re-highlighting the material, why not start developing with it?
   Instead of _deferring_ my best thinking, why not start _doing_ my best thinking?
	 
> The idea is to master habits that allow us to enjoy using our system, so that it becomes a comfortable nest we can return to , relax in and grow from. Using our muscles of dedication and focus to make best use of our time, we can then forge ahead with this idea emergence as our tool toward authentic engagement & collaborative conversations with our ideas.


### The Compound Effect of NOTE-MAKING

What if instead of spending time highlighting the highlights, you spent the same amount of time developing your own nuanced thoughts—your unique take—on the ideas you encounter?

>**Progressive Ideation** is the process of _relating and developing ideas over time._ Through this process, your thinking efforts naturally compound.

If practiced, “Progressive Ideation” will develop the habits of:

1.  engaged thinking (this leads to more “flow”)
2.  sensemaking (relating ideas and making leaps of insights). Making sense of the things we are interested in
3.  creative expression
4.  Dynamic PFM system

### What does Progressive Ideation look like in practice?

It’s some version of the following:

1.  Create new ideas (or Highlight, comment on, or extract ideas)
2.  Connect ideas
3.  Develop ideas
4.  Create with those ideas (as needed)

> From these **“thought collisions”** in your dynamically growing digital library, you naturally start to create stuff. An article. A product. A business. Or simply a well-connected, super dependable, digital conversation partner. One that knows all the same jokes you do! One that often says, “Hey, remember when…”
>
>  You are no longer a regurgitation machine. You are a generation machine.

### Evergreen Notes
- Clear, Concise, Distinct (Atomic): The title for evergreen notes should be a clear title or statement.
- Own Words & unique perspective: The title for evergreen notes should be a clear title or statement.
- Linked
- Non-static

### THINGS notes vs OPINION notes
- which ones is bad?
Thing notes tend to be seen as bad because you might be just copying static concept, but thing notes can be used to create opinion notes
- Which ones is evergreen?
Both are evergreen. 
copying just wikipedia and not using the notes it makes them not evergreen.

### The Unique benefits of Note Making:

When you practice note-_making_ you develop notes that:

-   Can be reused for projects today and into the future
-   Sharpen your thinking
    -   Making clear, concise, and sometimes opinionated, notes demand a certain level of clarity in thinking.
-   Encourage leaps of insights
    -   Cultivating a growing mass of evergreen notes opens up a powerful way of connecting ideas and generating insights.
-   Reduces anxiety and stress
-   Creates the conditions for Flow
-   Creates a Positive Feedback Loop of positive experiences working with ideas
-   And it grows in value over time

### The basic steps of evergreen note-making

**Evergreen note-**making forces clear, sharp thinking. If you like steps, here are the clear, sharp steps.

1.  figure out the key statement
2.  write the note in your own words
3.  relate the idea in the note to your personal experiences
4.  link the idea in the note to other ideas

#### Fluid Thinking
> **Fluid Thinking** is the ability to skillfully adjust your perspective— zooming in and out of the levels of emergence. This allows you to approach a problem from the inside and the outside…tacking back and forth with ease to generate new value and find novel solutions.

## Unit 3 - Accelerating Ideas
> “**Thought Collisions**” are when you have thoughts interact with other thoughts.
> 
### Maps of content

An MOC is a dedicated space for thinking. In such a space we can:
-   overcome the **Mental Squeeze Point**
-   maximize quality **Thought Collisions**
-   and progressively build ideas

MOC can do:
-   MOCs can structure links in completely countless and non-linear ways.
-   MOCs can be a combo of links and tags and text and embeds and anything you can think of.
-   MOCs can be linked to other MOCs (Emergence Level 4), which eventually link to a Home note (Emergence Level 5).
-   And most valuable, MOCs concentrate & accelerate idea interaction.

#### Why use MOCs

1.  MOCs help you **manage anxiety** in a positive way by allowing you a dedicated space to place related notes together
2.  In that space, MOCs create a concentrated environment that **encourages rapid ideation** through the interaction, exchange, and development of thoughts, notions, and ideas.
3.  After you’ve developed an MOC you’re happy with, it **becomes a reference** for whatever project you need to complete: an essay, a product, a summation of thought on a topic. Thanks to developing your MOC, you might find that your new project is already 80% complete.
4.  The MOC remains as a **reliable navigational tool** to the rest of your digital library.
5.  The MOC also **acts as a reminding tool** on a subject. Years later you can quickly return to it and remember, “Oh I remember now, that’s what I thought about the how the evolution of fonts related to the broader movements of Art History!”
6.  The MOC **remains ready to evolve** as your thoughts grow, mature, develop complexity on a subject.
7.  MOCs **maintain their fluidity**: As opposed to folders, MOCs are nondestructive, non-restrictive, non-limiting perspectives. Unlike a folder, you are not forced to use them to access your notes. MOCs are “overlays” that add relevant information but that don’t affect your base level notes.
8.  MOCs **allow for limitless flexibility**. Unlike folders or Table of Contents (TOC), MOCs are not hierarchical. They are heterarchical. This means that different MOCs can map the same info in different ways, to fit whatever your current needs might be.
9.  MOCs **encourage “Relational Positioning”**: Don’t argue with the Ancient Greeks and Romans about the value of spatial relationships. It helps us remember better when ideas are not floating in isolation, but as a part of a spatial constellation.
    -   The Ancients filled their minds with tomes of knowledge that they could recall when needed. The underlying principle was the “Method of Loci” (loci being Latin for “places”), which is a strategy of memory enhancement by visualizing familiar spatial environments to improve the recall of information.

#### MOCs Attributes
1.  **Non-destructive**: The notes that are linked within are not affected.
2.  **Non-exclusive**: MOCs don’t limit discoverability
3.  **Non-limiting**: You can create countless variations of structure.
4.  **Co-existing**: MOCs don’t impede other MOCs.
5.  **Heterarchial**: There is no hard-coded, rigid top-down structure.
6.  **Overlapping**: MOCs can link to the same notes, no big deal.
7.  **Augment-able**: MOCs can quickly augment the view of your library
8.  **Neighborly**: MOCs stay out of the way, unless you need them.
9.  **Delete-able**: You can delete MOCs and your notes remain unaltered (unlike folders).
    -   You’ve lost _value_ but you haven’t lost _information_.
10.  **Fluid**: Like water, MOCs can form to the changing shape of your needs.

### The three phases of MOCs
####  **1 - Assembling Phase**
_Assemble, Collect, Gather, Curate, Incubate_ - Put related stuff on a new digital workbench. 

Imagine having a warehouse of limitless workbenches, and for each workbench you curate the notes placed on it. Whenever you feel you need to get a handle on a bunch of notes on `Subject XYZ`, just throw them all onto a new workbench—i.e. place their links into a new MOC note titled `Subject XYZ MOC`. Now it's easier to begin.


#### **2 - Colliding Phase**
_Collide, Develop, Rearrange, Combine, Split, Sharpen, Craft_ - Have your ideas battle for relational positioning. This is the most joyous and valuable stage.

Once you have all your ideas in one MOC, use it like a crucible where ideas can battle it out for positioning, forcing you to grind them to their fundamental essence—thinking of their proximal importance to each other and building stronger connective tissue between them. Great work is accomplished during in this conceptual battle royale. The product of this work is rarely one without satisfaction.

#### **3 - Unifying Phase**
_Unify & Merge with the whole; Enjoy, Use, Navigate, Reference_ -  Enjoy the spatial constellation you created.

It's most likely meaningful to you. Use it for different purposes: for final products (content creation), as a reference point in the future, as a navigational hub, or for the inherent joy the ideas provide.

As you finish work on an area of interest, the MOC remains as a renewable summation of thought for the future you. An MOC is your easy access point back into the topic—whether that's tomorrow or in ten years.

### Three Ways the Map-Maker Creates Value

**Match-making**  
The map maker creates value by grouping ideas together, merging some, breaking apart others, and ultimately deciding who goes where.

**Sense-making**  
The map maker creates value by grappling with ideas, trying to understand them and relate them to something else to has meaning.

**Taste-making**  
The map maker creates value by deciding which ideas to pack together, how much each idea says, what their tone and shape is, and what story they tell.

> “MOCs are self-organizing, tightly-packed, idea-forging spaces.”

> “MOCs are evergreen, living launchpads to associated thoughts.”

### The goal is Fluid Thinking

**Fluid Thinking** is the awareness and skill to think from the right level of abstraction at the right time.

> This is your ability to deftly adjust your perspective, zooming out and in, bouncing up and down the levels of emergence, so you can approach a problem from the inside and the outside, tacking back and forth between those extremes.
