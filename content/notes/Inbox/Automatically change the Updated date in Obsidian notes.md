Install the the community plugin  [Markdown Prettifier](https://github.com/cristianvasquez/obsidian-prettify)

Set the same format as in the "Template" Obsidian Core Plugin extension date. In my case, I used the following:

`updated: "{{date:M/DD/YYYY}}"`

Thanks to this, now you can run the Markdown Prettifier after modifying a note and it will automatically update the date in that note.
