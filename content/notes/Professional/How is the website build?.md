# How is the website build?

- The website was created using GatsbyJS and deploying with netlify
- Used the [GatsbyJS starter: Minimal Blog](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-minimal-blog)
- Added support to double brackets links using the `gatsby-remark-double-brackets-link` and `gatsby-transformer-markdown-references`
