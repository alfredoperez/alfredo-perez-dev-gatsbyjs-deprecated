# How this works

- My workflow is located on https://whimsical.com/digital-garden-15FWj9nugBrPiv5e53SHp8

## Notes

-use a seedbox to dump notes
-use tags only on the frontmatter

- How I separate note:
  - Personal -> bullet journal for time blocking and goals, journal, habits, etc
  - Work -> Private vault
  - Obsidian: for the notes I will like to keep

## Tools

- Pocket for articles
- Kindle for books
- GatsbyJS to create site
- Alfred for automation
- Obsidian for note-making

### What are your use cases again?

The goal of this PKM/Digital Garden is to have a place for all the interesting things I come across and also a place where I can share what I am learning or exploring.
Some of the use cases are:

- Learning Notes: Notes from workshops, courses, podcasts, videos or articles
- Evergreen Notes: New things I am creating
- Inspiration: this can be screenshots or links to websites I like
- Links: This note will contain only links for a related subject.

### What are your biggest sticking points?

### What are your workflow rules?

For Learning notes:

- Make notes from the source instead of just storing the source
- Use headers as a way to separate ideas. This will help to reference specific ideas in other notes
- Use the type tags to identify them
- Put them in the Professional or Personal folder

For Evergreen Notes:

- Use the status tags to identify them
- Put them in the Professional or Personal folder

For inspiration Notes:

- Create an inspiration notes for a related subject and add screenshots and links

## For Links Notes:

### Where are you encountering new things?

Web articles, Twitter, YouTube, Forums, books, courses, workshops

### How are you processing the different things you encounter?

- Articles:
- Twitter:
- YouTube:
- Forums:
- Books:
- Courses:
- Workshops:
